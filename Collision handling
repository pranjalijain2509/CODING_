#Collision handling
#They are bound to happen if more than 1 key will point to the same index in the hash table

#we we know the key in advance then we can do perfect hashing
#if we do not know the key then we can use one of the following
    #chaining 
    #open addressing 
        #linear probling
        #Quadratic Probling
        #Double hashing
